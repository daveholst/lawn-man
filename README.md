# Lawn Manager Client
This is the client web-app designed to interact with the Lawn Manager Server over the GraphQL API. It is designed to be deployed to a Herokuish server using the mars build pack. Lawn Manager allows users to setup their properties, connect juiceBox fertigation devices and openSprinkler irrigation controllers to allow autonomous fertilising of lawns and garden beds. Through this client users can calculate fertigation recipes and run them on selected zones.
